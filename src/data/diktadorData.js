    'Diktador! is a strategic card game set against the backdrop of authoritarian rule. Players take on the roles of citizens navigating the tension between complicity and resistance under a dictatorship.',
    'Developed in collaboration between Project Gunita and the Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP), the game transforms the weight of history into an interactive, thought-provoking experience — making the lessons of the Martial Law era accessible through play.',
    'Each role card represents a real archetype from Philippine history: people who resisted, people who collaborated, and people caught in between. Your choices shape the outcome.',
